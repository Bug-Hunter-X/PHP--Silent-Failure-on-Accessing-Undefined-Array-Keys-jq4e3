This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, bug in PHP: the silent failure when accessing undefined array keys.  The `bug.php` file showcases the problem, where accessing a non-existent key produces a `Notice` but continues execution, potentially leading to incorrect results.  The `bugSolution.php` file offers a solution using `isset()` or `array_key_exists()` to explicitly check for the key's existence before accessing it.
