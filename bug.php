In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that aren't explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["foo"] = 1;
$myArray["bar"] = 2;

echo $myArray["baz"]; // Notice:  Undefined index: baz in ...
?>
```

PHP will not throw an error if you try to access a non-existent array key. Instead, it'll simply return `null` (which is often treated as 0 in numerical contexts), potentially leading to unexpected behavior or logic errors further down the line.  This silent failure can be very difficult to track down.
